# Contributing

This project is built by AI coding sessions and humans following the same
process. **Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first** — it is the canonical guide.
This file covers what a human needs to get set up, and the short version.

## Getting started

Node 22 or later. The browser tests need Chromium, installed once by
Playwright.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bardic-inspiration/space
cd space
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run validate
```

Core is a git dependency that the lockfile names over ssh. Without ssh access
to GitHub, `npm install` needs it rewritten to https:

```bash
git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "ssh://git@github.com/"
```

## The short version

- **One concern per PR**, on a branch from `main`. Link its issue, or state
  the task in the description.
- **Test first, and `check` green before you push** — CI runs the same
  command.
- **PRs land by squash merge:** the title becomes the commit subject on `main`
  and the description its body, so write both for `git log`.
- **Never force-push a pushed branch**; merge `main` in to catch up.

The details — issues, branches, commits, PRs, merging — are in
[`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md).
